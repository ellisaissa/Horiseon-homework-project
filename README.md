The purpose of this website is to advertise for Horiseon. The company provieds social solution services. In short they help with online reputations, optimizing brand notoriety with search engines, and basic marketing using social media. The work order provided said the site wanted to be more accessible and for the code to be simpler. I was given the original website HTML and CSS files to start and worked off of those. In my changes I did the following:
 -I added a simple and consise title for the page which would help with searches. 
 -I also added tags to the images so they would have descriptions and it would explain what each was for in an image search. 
 -Reorganizing the CSS file allowed me to make finding each part and editing it a lot easier. 
 
 I did delete one portion I wasn't able to get back and it edited the page wrong but, you live and you learn. As a first assignmet and someone who is completely new to computer programming I think some mistakes will be made but it's an opportunity to learn. Below are the screenshots of the finished site.
